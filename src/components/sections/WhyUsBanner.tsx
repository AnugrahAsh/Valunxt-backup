 * The "Why us?" glass banner, on both home pages.

 * A full-bleed photograph with a frosted panel over its left third. Runs

 * on India, "Every Number Has to Hold Up" on the UAE) rather than replacing it
 * — those keep their own copy and their own blur panel.

 * Neither claim below is new. India's is the engagement terms already stated on
