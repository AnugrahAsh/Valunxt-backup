/**
 * Leadership and senior advisers — /about/leadership/.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS FILE IS INTENTIONALLY EMPTY AND THE PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY NOT LIVE.
 *
 * The page template, styling and structured data are finished and working. The
 * only thing missing is the people, and those are facts about real individuals
 * — names, job titles, professional credentials and regulatory registrations.
 * Inventing them would put fabricated professional qualifications on a
 * regulated advisory firm's website, so they have been left for Valunxt to
 * supply.
 *
 * While this array is empty, /about/leadership/ returns 404 and is absent from
 * the navigation and the sitemap. Add one or more entries below and the page
 * goes live immediately — no template changes needed. Then add it to
 * src/components/layout/MainNav.tsx (the About submenu) and sitemap.xml.
 *
 * Credentials must be ones the individual actually holds and can evidence:
 * MRICS/FRICS require current RICS membership, "RERA-approved valuer" requires
 * a live registration number, and so on.
